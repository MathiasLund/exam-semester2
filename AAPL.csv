43,"One of the most helpful things to know in trying to get inside President Trump’s head is that he can never, ever, be shamed in even the smallest way. And although he gloried in claiming, untruthfully, that the Mueller report verified that there was “no collusion” between his campaign and the Russians, there’s a huge reason why he continues to be so fixated on the report. The reason is the report documents in great detail how hard the Russians worked to get him elected, and to enable his razor-thin victory. Talk about shame! His greatest lifetime achievement wouldn’t have happened without the help of our most evil enemy. So he continues to roll his witch hunt thing, I get that. But the call to Putin is really scary. Here, I can’t get in his head. Is he trying to convince us the Russians are good guys? A better question—can we survive until January of 2021?

As long as he can keep his exchanges hidden from those with any discernment he will lie, cheat and steal. Mazie Horono nailed it on the head.
