...Shares of Texas Instruments rallied after the numbers, but lost ground during a later conference call with analysts. Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said revenue declines are the result of customers cutting back on orders after a prolonged period of building up stocks of components. Typically such a period of growth is followed by four or five quarters of declines, he said. He stressed that was historical perspective rather than a prediction...

Same Trade BS headlines to pump the stock prices. How many times the market can ""rally"" on a trade ""hopes""? 100, 200, 300 times?? At first the deal was about trade deficit, then Trump and the US government see that Chinese Government is easygoing and trying to close the deal, Trump and his troll buddies came up with long unacceptable wishlist to HUMILIATE China and Chinese people. I hope China will have a national honor and will reject the deal and will destroy US.

58,"TXN with older product trading at premium while $NVDA with newer technology at discount. Sure downturn at NVDA seems worst but TXN only advantage right now is Smart Speaker price war between Amazon and Google and chinnese makers.

This flooding market with smart speaker which required quite a bit Analog Chips. But How sustain those market is. I really think people buying because how cheap they get sold and not because they think Home automation is way to go. Infact many don't want to have it running while they have family time and discussing stuff. Also people don't understand what would happen if malware take over your smart speaker. Both Amazon and Google seems build on top of Android OS and it's open source.

I think market overpricing this. And it's likely classic pump and dump. We just don't know when dump will start. May be AMD earning will trigger that.
