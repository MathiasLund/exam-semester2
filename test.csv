...Shares of Texas Instruments rallied after the numbers, but lost ground during a later conference call with analysts. Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said revenue declines are the result of customers cutting back on orders after a prolonged period of building up stocks of components. Typically such a period of growth is followed by four or five quarters of declines, he said. He stressed that was historical perspective rather than a prediction...

Same Trade BS headlines to pump the stock prices. How many times the market can ""rally"" on a trade ""hopes""? 100, 200, 300 times?? At first the deal was about trade deficit, then Trump and the US government see that Chinese Government is easygoing and trying to close the deal, Trump and his troll buddies came up with long unacceptable wishlist to HUMILIATE China and Chinese people. I hope China will have a national honor and will reject the deal and will destroy US.

This flooding market with smart speaker which required quite a bit Analog Chips. But How sustain those market is. I really think people buying because how cheap they get sold and not because they think Home automation is way to go. Infact many don't want to have it running while they have family time and discussing stuff. Also people don't understand what would happen if malware take over your smart speaker. Both Amazon and Google seems build on top of Android OS and it's open source.

I think market overpricing this. And it's likely classic pump and dump. We just don't know when dump will start. May be AMD earning will trigger that.

109,"Texas Instruments statistics look outstanding, in this day and time. Why is it not holding a better average? If anything posted in the news that is negative, the stock falls. It looks like an overall nervousness in the market, rather than a basic problem.

113,"Semiconductors are used by companies making things, they are not an end product in themselves. Semis are a leading indicator and it is true that there is a slowdown however at this time it is a slow down in growth not a decline. The end market for products using semis is growing, diversifying and creating new markets with the percentage content of semis within those products increasing. Semis are a capital intensive and high r&amp;d expense industry. This is the future, the catalyst for growth and wealth, wake up to its true strength and underlying influence on wealth creation.

Telling the truth is not bashing. I used to own this scam, but I got rid of it above $30.00. It is a Pump and Dump SCAM! Didn't you see how it fell by 14% early in the morning within seconds??? You know what that means? Owners are dumping blocks. You are paying for worthless shares. Get rid of this SCAM asap!

Morningstar set $9.00 fair value for $AMD BUBBLE which is a way overoptimistic, while Citigroup has $4.00 PT for this garbage! I am just telling the reality. You keep pumping this BUBBLE all day long. Do your DD and see how garbage $AMD is. Just click financials and see the reality!

Going below $2.00 again! DO NOT try to catch falling knife. This stock will be down at least for 10 years. Do not hope for free money. Next hype will be in 10 years.

The really good part is that there is nothing wrong specifically with the stock, it is just part of a general wipe-out. I got in at 102.5 after a limit order and quite frankly thought I would miss it. Well, it fell farther, but that's okay I never get in at THE bottom, and it has already recovered from my entrance. I'm just glad I'm back in. See ya early next year around $125+.

144,"China has achieved many engineering skills but they have not achieved any credibility in semiconductors. The vast majority of products made in China using semiconductors of even modest capability are imported. If companies such as TI are to be considered negatively impacted by trade disputes, you should then have far greater concerns about the companies who use Chinese subcontractors to build their products and also indigenous Chinese companies.

If TI and similar non Chinese semiconductor manufactures, the vast majority, are impacted China will not be able to produce any meaningful product or their costs will rise.

162,"When I read or view posts from even well established market analysts I feel they really have no idea what companies like TI or STM actually do. The largest value of a car is now electronics and climbing, almost no industrial machine is not only controlled by electronics but monitored by them. LED lighting saves 92% of electrical energy versus old lamps. Almost everything we do every second of the day has semiconductors driving, monitoring or influencing them in every aspect of almost every company on the stock market and this is accelerating. Semiconductor companies such as TI and STM have a broad spectrum of IP, production capacity and market presence that enable them to be a catalyst of change and enabler for companies to grow. Simple comments such as Apple next gen phone is only selling 10% more the end is nigh, indicates this poor understanding. These companies are the new Petrochemical, Steel, Coal base of our global economies solid always present not always flashy but consistent.
